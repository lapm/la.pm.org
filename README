*** Los angeles perl mongers website ***

About:
Using pm-website from App::PM::Website to build and install the
la.pm.org website.

Configuration:
'pm-website build' requires a config file (default =
./config/pm-website.yaml ) and a template file ( default =
./template/index.tt ). and outputs TT rendered data
( default = ./website/index.html )

'pm-website install' requires a config file (default =
./config/pm-website.yaml) and a file to push (default =
./website/index.html ).  Credentials for DAV are read from
$HOME/.netrc if it exists and is not readable by others.

config/pm-website.yaml example:

config:
    url         : https://groups.pm.org/groups/losangeles/
    machine     : groups.pm.org
    username    : spazm
    certificate : cacert.pem
location:
    ...hash of locations...
presenter:
    ...hash of presenters...
meetings:
    ... array of events, will be sorted by event_date ...
    ... array locations refer to location entries ...
    ... meetings have presentations which reference presenters ...

The template code will be given several variables:
    m         => the next meeting
    l         => location of the next meeting
    meetings  => previous meetings (does not include m)
    presenter => hash of all presenters
    location  => hash of all locations

$HOME/.netrc configuration for perl monger groups:
  machine groups.pm.org
  login $YOUR_LOGIN
  password $YOUR_PASSWORD

cacert.pm is the develooper.com public certificate for making SSL
connections during DAV.  This is listed in the config::certificate
section of pm-website.yaml.
