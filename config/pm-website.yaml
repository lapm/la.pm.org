That he possesses the power to become invisible to finance companies; that his laboratory is tooled up to manufacture destructive robots he refers to as "Heavy Metal Apes" on a fantastic scale; and that he owns one of the rare mouths in which butter has never melted are legends treasured by every schoolboy.  <br> Shackled to the mighty wheel of Nami Media, Chuck spends his few hours outside of work raising turkeys which he occasionally displays on Thousand Oaks Boulevard, and stirs little from his alembics and retorts. Those who know hint that the light burning late in his laboratory may result in a breathtaking electric bill. Queried, he shrugs with the fatalism of your true Oriental. "Mektoub," he observes curtly. "It is written."'

Oh, and my version of the story of the Schwartzian Transform. I'll also give my views about the current and future Perl, and what Perl 6 means to the community and to me as a professional."

Shifting dependencies, incompatible interfaces and test failures in CPAN modules can suddenly break your application, leaving your team to chase bugs they didn't create. But managing CPAN modules doesn't have to be painful.  A private Pinto repository gives you a stable platform for making consisten builds and managing upgrades for all your Perl modules.  Start building your applications with the right modules, every time.  I'll show you how."

        abstract: The CPAN is a blessing and a curse.  You can find code for every problem imaginable, but managing all those dependencies is extremely frustrating.  Until now.  Pinto is one example of a new breed of tools for managing your Perl dependencies.  In this presentation we will explore what Pinto does, demonstrate how to use it in the development cycle, and compare it with similar tools.

        title: AnyEvent -- Perl Asynchronous Programming
        abstract: Event driven programming has been a powerful paradigm for years, but it's emerging as an increasingly important way to work. Making events easy is part of what has made node.js so exciting, and is possible in Python with Eventlet and Ruby with EventMachine. Perl's answer to this is very mature and flexible: AnyEvent. As well as an introduction to the module, how to use it, and some of the other modules in the "family", we'll cover some before/after examples of synchronous code made asynchronous.

        title: Epistemology & Perl Oracles
        abstract: Most of us are familiar with the output of Perl's native test oracle every time we install a module from CPAN, ok, not ok.  When testing, did you ever think that you might need to know more than that to isolate faults?  This discussion covers the Test Anything Protocol (TAP), capturing system events & using Perl to lean more what you know & what you don't know about the application you are testing.
