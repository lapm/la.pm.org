>      The most dimensionally rich reports were generally scheduled
      reports, since it didn't make sense to present such voluminous
      data in a web UI.</P
><P
>      Our initial solution was therefore bifurcated: We still cubes a
      limited set of dimensions for UI presentation purposes, while
      sending full log files to Hadoop for scheduled reports.  A
      batched report doesn't need to have a sub-second response
      time.</P
><P
>      This meant we could actually expand the dimensions available in
      our scheduled reports, since Hadoop gets the raw log
      files.</P
><P
>      It also meant we could perform free-form analytics on our log
      data in future, using Hive as an exploratory tool.  Maybe we
      could ask even better questions of our data in future, which
      could in turn suggest better scheduled reports to present to our
      customers.</P
><P
>      If our traffic volume increased to the point where even our
      cubed data with limited dimensions are taking too long to load,
      we could have gone to a model where we updated the UI-facing
      relational tables from our Hive database.</P
><P
>      Too bad the company died and none of that happened.  But, uh, it
      was a good idea.</P
